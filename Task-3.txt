The above 9 words would be the stoplist as per my opinion.

These words are chosen based on their frequencies and these are the highly ranked words in the given corpus.
The reason to consider these above mentioned words as stop words because they appear more number of times,
in the corpus and they have very little meaning of their own. Thus they do not affect result much.

At the same time, not all high frequency words can be considered stop words. This is because,
in this corpus the word "energy" is ranked 10th but making this a stop word will affect the system.
Because "energy" is an important word in its own right and it could aslo be that many articles will
be based on energy. Thus it is not feasible to make all the high ranking words as stop words.

the best solution to this is to not keep a stop list at all. This way all the words will be indexed,
and everyword can be searched for. However, this does have a downside of memory consumption but still 
not having a stoplist is a better for processing queries like "to be not to be".
